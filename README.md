# IP Address Resolver Project

**Objective**

In this project we want to focus on network concepts that could be used to develop applications.

**Concepts**

These concepts are the main used concepts in the project solution, kindly read the provided resources if any is new to you.

| Concept   |      Resources      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| IP Addresses |  [What is an IP Address (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IP_Address) |
| Host/Domain Name |    [Lenovo documentation of what is a host name ](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/glossary/hostname/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)   |
| InetAddress Package (Java) | [InetAddress documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html) |



**Problem**

Develop a method that takes a host name as an input and returns its ip address.

**Implementation**

Write the implementation of the `getIpByHostName` method. After that, call it with a valid input.
```Java
public static String getIpByHostName(String hostName){
        String ipAddress = null;
        /* Your code here */
        return ipAddress;
        }
```
